üòé Awesome list of wordle-like games

## What is [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

Wordle is simple: You have six chances to guess the day's secret five-letter word. Type in a word as a guess, and the game tells you which letters are or aren't in the word. The aim is to figure out the secret word with the fewest guesses.
